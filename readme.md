# Sputnik front end coding challenge

You can view the project [here](https://123lk.github.io/sputnik/) 

## Design approach

I broke the design down into 3 main sections; nav, carousel and services.  

I have used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for the site.  I decided to use HTML and CSS as they are two of the core technologies for building web pages.  

I decided to use Bootstrap as it can be used to develop responsive sites that work on various screen sizes.  As Bootstrap is designed to work at its best on the latest desktop and mobile browers I have included Respond.js and HTML 5 Shim to get support for IE8 and other older browers. 

I began by setting up the main sections and added in all the content, I then seperated the main sections into smaller sections to align content correctly.  I then started styling each section, continually checking responsiveness and the look and feel on different screen sizes.  

## Further developlment

The remainder of the page has 4 main sections; mission, regions, news, footer. 

### Mission section 
For the mission section I would make use of Bootstraps grid framework, similar to how I approached the service section, and split the row by having two columns.  The mission section on the right would be another Bootstrap carousel. 

### Regions section
The Bootstrap accordian feature would work well for the left hand side list of regions.  I would use a combination of Javascript and CSS onhover to highlight different sections on the map.  The map section could also be achieved through creating a React.js component.  

### News section
This section would have a similar set up to the other split panel sections (service and mission).

### Footer section
This section also lends itself well to Bootstraps column model.  In order to not have each column stack on top of each other on a smaller screen I would use "hidden-xs" on each column apart from contact us.  Links would be added to the relevant pages of the website as well as social media links on the icons.  

## Timing 

I have spent 1.5 days on this project, I would envisage it taking a further 2 days to complete the project to a high standard.
